This is a ClickerGame, or it will become one. The project is mostly for coding practice.

To Fix:

Current version uses util.scanner to read input. Problem is, when called, the program waits for input and does nothing else.
I need it to run other tasks but is always ready to get an input. I will check out java.util.concurrent to implement some kind of multithreading.
